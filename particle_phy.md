# Particle Physics

## Introduction to Particle Physics:
Particle Physics is a fascinating branch of Physics. It is a conjecture of Sophisticated theories describing elegant and simple observartions. Numerous attempts has been done to understand the nature of interactions among the fundamental constituents of matter.Study of fundamental constituents of matter, their makeup and the interactions governing them at miniscule scales remains as the primary goal of this field of study. While Nuclear physics has its own way of describing the mysteries of nature, Particle Physics develops its intuition from Nuclear Physics and goes a step ahead. The primary goal of the field can be summarized as follows:

•	What are the basic building blocks of matter? 
•	What is inside the nucleus? 
•	What are the forces that hold matter together? 
•	How did the universe begin? 
•	Will the universe end, and if so, how and when?
•	How good is the Standard Model of Physics and more….


## Historical Perspective:

•	In 1930 the known elementary particles were the proton, the electron, and the photon.
•	Thomson identified ‘electron’ in 1897, and Einstein’s work on the photoelectric effect can be defined what is a ‘photon’ (originally called a quantum) in 1905. The proton is the nucleus of the hydrogen atom. 
•	Despite the rapid progress of physics in the first couple of decades of the twentieth century, no more elementary particles were discovered until 1932, when Chadwick proved the existence of the neutron, and Carl Anderson identified the positron in cosmic rays. 
•	Dirac in 1928 introduced the relativistic theory of the electron when he combined quantum mechanics with relativity. He found that his wave equation had negative, as well as positive, energy solutions.
•	He3 interpreted the solutions as a vacuum being filled with an infinite sea of electrons with negative energies. If enough energy is transferred to the “sea”, an electron can be ejected with positive energy leaving behind a hole that is the positron, denoted by e+. This postulated the existence of antiparticles and it was later confirmed by Carl Anderson.
