# Particle Physics

## Introduction to Particle Physics:
Particle Physics is a fascinating branch of Physics. It is a conjecture of Sophisticated theories describing elegant and simple observartions. Numerous attempts has been done to understand the nature of interactions among the fundamental constituents of matter.Study of fundamental constituents of matter, their makeup and the interactions governing them at miniscule scales remains as the primary goal of this field of study. While Nuclear physics has its own way of describing the mysteries of nature, Particle Physics develops its intuition from Nuclear Physics and goes a step ahead. The primary goal of the field can be summarized as follows:  
  
•	How did the universe begin? 
•	Will the universe end, and if so, how and when?  
•	How good is the Standard Model of Physics and more….  

To understand more, Let's begin with the QCD Phase diagram. What does the QCD Phase diagram talk about?  
1. Explains the evoultion of the Universe.  
2. Explains the dominant phases of matter at each epoch.  
3. Big rip or Big crunch (Subject to interpretations)
